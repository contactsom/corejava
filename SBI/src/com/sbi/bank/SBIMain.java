//can we create EmployeeAbstract in in another class as a 
//subclass with a same namecan we create EmployeeAbstract 
//in in another class as a subclass with a same name


//Sir, any kind of .jar file won't show the code, or just  
//because of abstract class it is not showing 

//sir, is creating class in java is compulsory to write any
//code?


//then what special about abstract class ? 
//if it is the speciality of .Jar  fle

//if we create a abstract class that is protected  
//so can we use that name for another class
