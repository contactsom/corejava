TODO:
what is the use of static keyword ?
without creating object..we cannot access methods...is this the only way to access methods


//but what is the purpose of having two ways




we we can write the code in progress if we want to try something for ajust checking 



//List of examples ...you promised to give for practice.



Next week
Interview question :How to achieve or implement Abstraction in Java?


// abstract / default / protected ->  



//sir you have shown us  2ways to get the output .. 
//one by using retun & one by using Syso in the method.. 
//what is the main difference ? & what is the rigth way ? //dineshsamai ? 


//I am slightly confused with the object creation of this class within the same class.
//I would have thought that you will create it outside the class.

//Can we create a object with another class name? //from shashijha888 to All Participants:

//Sir, are you saynig INTENTIATED or INITIATED

//can we return more than one values at a time  - only one value at a time 

//best practice is to create an object of another class but for 
//easier understanding Om is creating the object of self.



How to create  the method
How to call the method
How to return the value form method
How to pass the argumrnt in to the method.
What is the difference between abstarct and final method 
	


abstract void getMe1(); 
	// Why abstract method needed 



//What other methods can be overridden???








String output = "" --> Can this be moved to the main class? Which is best practice?





we can return multiple values provided those multiple values are part of one single object.

shashijha888
we are confused due to some word like override



pulic - every where 
abstract - currently you do not have implementation 
private -  can be accessable in same class
protected - different pacakge with child class object
            same pacakge but different class
                
final - we not not override
