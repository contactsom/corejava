Difference between a++ & ++a

you without any refernce to any variable or in other words the incremented value is not 
used in the program any where? is my understanding correct


int a=10;

CASE 1:
a++ // 10+1=11
print (a)//I have not stored any where hense I ma having old value only i.e 10

CASE 2:
c=a++// 10+1=11
// I have assigned 11 in to variable c

print(c)//11


why increment only by 1. Why not 2 or 4 or 0.5 ?


is + operator always increment the value = TRUE/FALSE 


sir = and == both are same or not.  - not  same 
a==b : true or false 
a=b  : assign b value in to a
 

line 17 b1=b3.my 2nd ques is can we concatenate string and char.
my 3rd question is byte+1 where 1 is also in betweem -127 
and 128 why not taken 1 as byte

  int a=5;
  int b=6
  int c= (++a)+++b
  print(c) // ?








what is difference between ++a and a++ =?



int 


int a1=20; 
int a4=--a1;  
a4=19 how??



why have 2 types of increment before or after.- Yes
