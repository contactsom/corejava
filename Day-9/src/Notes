1. Extending the Thread Class
2. Implementing the Runnable Interface1


Q. Difference between t.strat & t.run() ?
In this case of t.start() a new thread will be created & that thread is responsible to
execute the run();

But in the case of t.run(), no new thread will be created & run method will be executed just like 
another method call.
