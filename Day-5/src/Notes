//what is the difference between constructor 
//and initialisation
//what is @override - 

//how object access
//Any thing related to hardware memory and initalize variable-NO
//is this the method of abstraction?in  OOP'S
//copy constructor maybe

//earlier you told constructor is used to
// initilize the object but now variable?

//default means 0...?

int 0
float 0.0
String null

does ZERO mean nothing ?
s
//Can you input some values to each object and 
//check the output? 

//so the only use constructor is  only to initialise variables in that class?


//Can we assing the value from any form?


object is not clear

//what is the difference between no argument constructor 
//and default constructor = Both are same 
//Exolain this.variable


//is object is nothing but copy of a class , I am right?


//sir how many objects is needed. 
//Like we are not aware how many users are present outside

//can we import package that is available in another disk (C : D) 



why we have assigned values  
in "ObjectExampleParameterConst.java" class,
if we can assign the values just like we did for Student 2 


Employee management 

Employee Name = Ravi
Emp ID = 201
Emp Email - Ravi@Gmail.com

Data entry 

StudentBranch sb2= new StudentBranch("Jon",303,"jon@yahoo.com");
StudentBranch sb3= new StudentBranch("Jon1",304,"jon1@yahoo.com");
StudentBranch sb4= new StudentBranch("Jon3",201,"jon3@yahoo.com");



//like current file is availble in disk c and previous 
//file is on D disk

//it is copy of class, but object has its own mind....
//like we are our parent;' children, but we have our own mind


//why we have assigned values  
in "ObjectExampleParameterConst.java" class, 
if we can assign the values just like we did for Sb2 




please creat new class

in ths example we will have same object name like sb2?
so if we print sb2, then how outcome will print?



sir, you have defined all as sb2, 
but have to dfined different names


in ths example we will have same object name like sb2?
so if we print sb2, then how outcome will print?


is constructor is a method? Shivadimon420
