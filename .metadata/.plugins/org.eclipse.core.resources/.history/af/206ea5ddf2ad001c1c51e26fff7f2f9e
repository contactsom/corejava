Collection Framework :

Collections(I)

List(I) :
    1. List will store duplicate data .

	Arraylist :   
	    2. Insertion order is preserved .
	    3. Memory utilization is less
	    4. Default size is allocated by JVM is 10
	    5. As soon as you will insert the 11th data , JVM will going to increase the size as below..
	       Formula is : new capacity=(current Capacity*3/2)+1 it is equivlent to ***%
	       
	       //if data type is long what is the minimum memory allocated?
	      // Is ti possible to impose size or not allow duplicates? - SET
