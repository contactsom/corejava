TODO:
Private class can be inherited by public class ?
if if don't have any implementation in Java programming so why we are using?
If you don't want to implement few methods they have to be in another interface? is it correct










What is interface ?
What is the use of interface ?
What is the advantage of interface ?
Interface is all about un-implementation ?Agree
from JAVA 8 onwards this statement is false / we will lwarn why , when we will learn java 8
for class extends key word is defined 
For interface we have implememts key word defined to make a parent , child relationship
What do you mean by interface implementation ?
Why interface should be only public ?
To implement an interface you must need one class
  



not agree- Why ?
maybe we can implement something
because it has implement has keyword
because we are developers and we have to implemente

not agreed,
user can implement stuff using the interface. 
For ex, hen they enter the pin for example, 
we are triggering the authentication process






ATM - insert ATM 
      ATM PIN 
      Amount 
      Ok
      withdraw  

Behind the seen : code is not visible 
    1. ATM is getting validated 
    2. PIN is getting validated 
    3. You account balance will be validated , sufficent/in-sufficent balance  
    4. getting money / not getting money
