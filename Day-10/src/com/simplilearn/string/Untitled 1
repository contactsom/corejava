String :

Why ?
Because String class is "Immutable"

What is "Immutable" ?
- Once we create a String object we can not perform any changes is the existing object.
If we are trying to perform any  changes with those changes a new object will be created.
This behavior is called "Immutability of String ".

 It compare the memory referance ID/Memory Address
 
 What is .equals() is String
 It compare the Content of String;
 
 StringBuffer is not Immutable.
